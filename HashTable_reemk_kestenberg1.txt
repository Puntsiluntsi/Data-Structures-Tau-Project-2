## Experiment 3
### Section A
- Size of Q1 is 3286
- Size of Q2 is 6571

### Section B

- Exceptions in QP: 90
- Exceptions in AQP: 0

The search sequence of an element in QP is Q1 (from section A) plus some constant 
(the element's hash), therefore QP checks 3286 places (~half the table) when 
searching for a suitable place to insert an element.
So when we try to fill up the whole table, we would likely get _TableIsFull_ errors
because all the places in the element's search sequence were taken (because the 
search sequence only contains half the table's indexes)

The search sequence of AQP is Q2 (from section A) plus some constant (the element's 
hash), therefore QP checks 6571 places (the whole table) when searching for a 
suitable place to insert an element.
So the search sequence for each element is the whole table, therefore we would only 
get _TableIsFull_ errors when the whole table is full - This never happens because we 
only insert m elements (the size of the table) and not a single element extra.
That is why we got 0 errors.
